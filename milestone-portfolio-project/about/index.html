						<p>I am a native Vermonter enjoying the pleasures of a west coast beach life in California! After a decade in the beauty industry I was ready for a change. Through the masterful teachings of my significant other, the tech world became increasingly intriguing. I dabbled with code on websites like codecademy.com and really enjoyed what I was learning. I decided to dive in! Im currently still learning through skillcrush.com and loving it! I expect to have a great base skillset when I graduate and cant wait to create more websites, apps, and software in the future! Please let me know if there is anything I could do for you!</p>
